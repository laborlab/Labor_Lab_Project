The documentation must indicate whether the duties were performed full time or, if part time, the percentage of times the other duties were performed. It is expected that this documentation is included in the employee's official personnel record. In order to receive credit for experience in your resume that is not within the official series and grade level of your official position, you must provide a copy of the appropriate documentation of such experience as indicated above.

If you are applying based on some other qualifying eligibility (i.e. you are not applying as a current Federal employee), you must meet the specific requirements of the eligibility you are claiming, and must have sufficient past experience to demonstrate that you are minimally qualified for this position. See Unique Hiring Paths on USAJOBS for more information about various ways you may be eligible to apply!

Description

Established in 1944, the World Bank Group (WBG) is one of the world’s largest sources of funding and knowledge for development solutions. The WBG consists of five specialized institutions: The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is the largest global development institution focused on the private sector in emerging markets. Working with 2,000 businesses worldwide, the Corporation uses over six decades of experience to create opportunities where they are needed most. Private sector financial development is essential to the promotion of successful and sustainable economies in low- and middle-income countries around the world. Sound and efficient financial markets can ensure that resources are allocated where they are most productive, assisting job creation and spurring economic growth.
IFC has embarked on an ambitious new growth strategy, the outcome of which will be to double our volume of business by 2030 and triple the work we do in Low Income Countries (LICs) and Fragile and Conflict affected States (FCS). To do so, IFC will need to deploy its full range of financing, mobilization, advisory, convening and thought leadership skills. This also calls for the need to generate our own opportunities by proactively working “Upstream” to create, deepen, and expand markets and opportunities for the private sector and to imagine, design and implement investment projects. This strategy also relies on a closer WBG collaboration through the “Cascade” approach: working with clients, we will first seek private sector solutions to address development challenges—where such solutions are advisable and can be effective—and reserve public financing for projects only when other options are suboptimal.
VPU Context: Information and Technology Solutions (ITS) enables the WBG to achieve its mission of ending extreme poverty by 2030 and boosting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner by delivering transformative information and technologies to its staff working in over 130 client countries. ITS services range from: establishing the infrastructure to reach and connect staff and development stakeholders; providing the devices and agile technology and information applications to facilitate the science of delivery through decentralized services; creating and maintaining tools to integrate information across the World Bank Group, the clients we serve and the countries where we operate; and delivering the computing power staff need to analyze development challenges and identify solutions. The ITS business model combines dedicated business solutions centers that provide services tailored to specific World Bank Group business needs and shared services that provide infrastructure, applications and platforms for the entire Group. ITS is one of three VPUs that have been brought together as the World Bank Group Integrated Services (WBGIS), to provide enhanced corporate core services and enable the institution to operate as one strategic and coordinated entity.
Unit Context: The mission of the Corporate Information Technologies Department (CIT) is to leverage technology to enable IFC’s strategic priorities and to support IFC’s business and operations. By acting as the technology partner and business enabler, the department provides state-of-art information and technology solutions to support IFC’s Investment & Advisory Services, Financial Operations, Treasury & the Asset Management Company. We work closely with the business to design solutions that automate business processes, help enable business responsiveness to clients, improve operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness, and manage risks. We are committed to delivering business solutions that deliver value for money while we continue to excel at the basics by providing IFC with an integrated digital platform that connects policies, processes, people, and knowledge across the institution in a holistic and staff-centric manner.

Description

Established in 1944, the World Bank Group (WBG) is one of the world’s largest sources of funding and knowledge for development solutions. The WBG consists of five specialized institutions: The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is the largest global development institution focused on the private sector in emerging markets. Working with 2,000 businesses worldwide, the Corporation uses over six decades of experience to create opportunities where they are needed most. Private sector financial development is essential to the promotion of successful and sustainable economies in low- and middle-income countries around the world. Sound and efficient financial markets can ensure that resources are allocated where they are most productive, assisting job creation and spurring economic growth.
IFC has embarked on an ambitious new growth strategy, the outcome of which will be to double our volume of business by 2030 and triple the work we do in Low Income Countries (LICs) and Fragile and Conflict affected States (FCS). To do so, IFC will need to deploy its full range of financing, mobilization, advisory, convening and thought leadership skills. This also calls for the need to generate our own opportunities by proactively working “Upstream” to create, deepen, and expand markets and opportunities for the private sector and to imagine, design and implement investment projects. This strategy also relies on a closer WBG collaboration through the “Cascade” approach: working with clients, we will first seek private sector solutions to address development challenges—where such solutions are advisable and can be effective—and reserve public financing for projects only when other options are suboptimal.
VPU Context: Information and Technology Solutions (ITS) enables the WBG to achieve its mission of ending extreme poverty by 2030 and boosting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner by delivering transformative information and technologies to its staff working in over 130 client countries. ITS services range from: establishing the infrastructure to reach and connect staff and development stakeholders; providing the devices and agile technology and information applications to facilitate the science of delivery through decentralized services; creating and maintaining tools to integrate information across the World Bank Group, the clients we serve and the countries where we operate; and delivering the computing power staff need to analyze development challenges and identify solutions. The ITS business model combines dedicated business solutions centers that provide services tailored to specific World Bank Group business needs and shared services that provide infrastructure, applications and platforms for the entire Group. ITS is one of three VPUs that have been brought together as the World Bank Group Integrated Services (WBGIS), to provide enhanced corporate core services and enable the institution to operate as one strategic and coordinated entity.
Unit Context: The mission of the Corporate Information Technologies Department (CIT) is to leverage technology to enable IFC’s strategic priorities and to support IFC’s business and operations. By acting as the technology partner and business enabler, the department provides state-of-art information and technology solutions to support IFC’s Investment & Advisory Services, Financial Operations, Treasury & the Asset Management Company. We work closely with the business to design solutions that automate business processes, help enable business responsiveness to clients, improve operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness, and manage risks. We are committed to delivering business solutions that deliver value for money while we continue to excel at the basics by providing IFC with an integrated digital platform that connects policies, processes, people, and knowledge across the institution in a holistic and staff-centric manner. CIT aims to ensure that our solutions meet the business needs of users across a range of functions including operations and corporate business processes, information, knowledge and learning, data and analytics, and more.

This position requires a degree or completion of specific courses in order to meet the basic education requirement. You must submit an official transcript, unofficial transcript, or a list including courses, grades earned, completion dates, and quarter and semester hours earned. Your transcript(s) must clearly demonstrate the course(s) listed in the Basic Qualification requirement section.

The documentation must indicate whether the duties were performed full time or, if part time, the percentage of times the other duties were performed. It is expected that this documentation is included in the employee's official personnel record. In order to receive credit for experience in your resume that is not within the official series and grade level of your official position, you must provide a copy of the appropriate documentation of such experience as indicated above.

There is of course all the typical PM stuff… scopes, schedules, budgets, client communications, etc. These are underappreciated, but important parts of the job. But the PM role at Taoti is far more strategic than at most agencies. Our PMs are the project heroes—the people who dig in, call the plays, and then oversee execution. You have a lot of control of the destiny of the project. You have a lot (some would argue too much) autonomy to just figure things out as you see best using our three core principles as your guiding light: Quality, Innovation, Service and Teamwork. You have access to a “QIST Fund” to do stuff that is ‘out of scope’ but helps move the needle for our clients. That is to say, while you do have dedicated designers and strategists on your team, there’s still the smaller, every day decisions that govern how the project go. Those calls are yours to make. And those are critical… like raising a kid, success doesn’t come in big milestone moments with a lot of fanfare. But constant attention, slight corrective actions, and ongoing encouragement—that’s how you succeed.*Note: * this role is for a full time position, but we are happy to consider applicants anywhere in the United States.*The challenges of this role…*Taoti puts out creative work that can go head to head with the biggest and best creative agencies in the world. But we’re doing so with a ~70 person team. So we need to be lean, efficient, and leverage our inner scrappiness to get the job done with fewer resources than what some of the big boys would throw at a project. So that often means wearing multiple hats and pitching in with production resources like UX, creative, IA, devs, etc. We’re not saying you have to be creating designs or banging out code. But you will have a lot of direct exposure to a lot of that stuff, and you’ll learn a lot about those trades—to the point where you can start thinking like some of them. And that’s a good thing.*Is there room for career growth?*That’s one of the best parts about this role, specifically at Taoti. In a larger shop, the project management hierarchy is usually large, layered, and not-so-flexible. Or at a smaller shop, you may have lots of flexibility, but not enough of a team to really benefit from true collaboration. Taoti is the Goldilocks of creative agencies. We have enough structure so that you understand what the team looks like and where you fit in. But we’re small and agile enough to let employees carve out new roles and niches where it makes sense to do so. Our teams and roles are constantly evolving as the team grows, so if you want to grow into a role that doesn’t exist, you can help create it! Our growth rate alone (targeted at 50% this year) means that the team will keep growing, which means we’ll be hiring additional people across all departments. And our hiring philosophy is all about hiring the next wave of employees that best supports the existing team. In other words, we grow the team around what we already have—not according to some org chart or spreadsheet. So career paths are not rigid and finite. We have a history of shaking things up, making rather bold HR moves, and adapting our hiring processes (as well as the roles of our existing employees) in a way that makes strategic sense for the employee and the company. For example, our VP of sales is now in charge of delivery. A previous creative director ended up mostly in sales. And we’ve created all sorts of new roles for new hires for positions that didn’t exist before, in some cases, creating whole new realms within our team structure. The point is that we’re committed to doing whatever makes the most sense and are agile enough to get away with it. So your career trajectory has far more to do with your own aptitude and initiative than it does with an org chart or who’s above you.*Tips for getting onto the short list…*Stand out. When you apply, make an impression.Even though we’re a full service agency, we do more than our fair share of web development. So experience with Drupal and/or Wordpress is a HUGE plus. If you’ve got it, tell us about it!Show—don’t tell—us how great you are.We can tell a lot by the documents someone creates. Doesn’t matter what it is, but we’d love to see some documents you’ve put together.Talk to us about your favorite tools.Give us some insight into your general PM philosophies.Tell us why you want to work at Taoti, specifically. And what was wrong with your last gig that makes you want to leave?Show us your passion and energy. We like passion and energy.First, a quick blurb about Taoti…Established in 1996, Taoti Creative is a boutique, full-service creative agency located on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. We are privately owned and have no corporate overloads (nothing personal, WPP.) We do stuff like web development, social media management, branding, experiential marketing, video, AR/VR, etc. Our mission is to ‘move the needle’ for our clients. We leverage technology, creativity, and innovation to generate meaningful and measurable results for our clients—that’s what drives us. Speaking of clients, they’re about 60% non-profits, 20% commercial, and 20% federal government. Some of our customers include World Bank, USAID, DC Water, Discovery Education, American Chemical Society, Jane Goodall Foundation, and dozens of ‘National Association of _____________,’ etc. Our full time team of about 75 employees is about 65% in-house and 35% remote. We hail from over 15 countries. And for the last four years in a row, we’ve made the Inc5000 list of fastest growing companies in the United States. There’s of course plenty of additional information on our website. If you’ve not done so already, be sure to check out our culture video: https://vimeo.com/289302105. Or if you’re feeling virtual, here’s guided tour of the office in 360 video! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7KkzdmSGTM (Warning: not suitable for printers.)*What’s the corporate culture like?*“Fun but focused,” as one Taoti put it, is a great way to sum up our culture. We’re a fun and casual shop. The kind of place where you can wear whatever, come and go as you please, and have autonomy over your own day for the most part. But we take the work seriously and believe deep in the mission to make meaningful and measurable impacts for our clients. All the perks and shenanigans and borderline irreverent tone are fun, but to really fit in here, you need to be about the work.We believe in something we call our “QIST Culture.” Quality. Innovation. Service. And Teamwork. We are always striving to improve these four areas (to the extent that we have a fund of a quarter million dollars per year that anyone can spend from in the interest of going above and beyond towards any of these four values.We also believe in total transparency and open communication across teams and across ranks. Instead of chain-of-command, we want everyone to have and share their own voice. Every other Thursday, the CEO holds ‘CafeClutch’ just so he can hear ideas and feedback directly from the team instead of through the filter of management.Want to see what life at Taoti looks like? Check out our Instagram or ‘about us’ video. There’s even a 360 tour of the office.*What about benefits?**(Some of these may vary based on location and working status.)*3 weeks PTO for starters. You gain more with tenure. And if you’re really big in to PTO, you can even trade back some salary for more.Telework options (which work like PTO… you accrue days with each paycheck. TELE days increase with tenure as well. By your fourth year, we don’t even count them any more.)100% company-paid medical, dental, and vision insurance. (50% for qualifying dependents.) And we have good insurance.Paid family leave for men and women (including PTO plus short and long term disability options.)3% retirement plan matching (plus access to a financial adviser).Home buyer help (including a $1200 closing credit)Mobile phone reimbursementYou can opt for a company-supplied PC or Mac laptop. Or if you want to use your own, we’ll reimburse you for it.Charitable contribution matchingTax-free metro benefitsA sincere respect for work/life balanceMoney and time off allocated for professional development (also increases with tenure)A diverse team hailing from over 15 countries last time we checkedA very hip/cool/funky/quirky office space on Barracks Row, in the heart of Capitol Hill. Just 2 blocks from the metro! (With the office space doubling in size next year as we build a new building in the parking lot next door to our building.)Fun perks like a roof deck, wine/beer always on tap, regular company boat outings (boat is walking distance from the office), chill work environment, etc.No real dress code (within reason, as long as you can be an adult about getting dressed for work)Annual global retreat (where we bring the whole team together for fun, games, and teamwork)Of course, the above is a quick list. Our handbook covers all the gory details.*Next steps…*If you’re qualified and interested, please apply on our website (https://www.taoti.com/careers.) Please note that these job ads often get placed onto other websites with their own application systems (we’re looking at you Jooble!) and some sites (looking at you Indeed!) have made up random salary ranges. We aren't able to respond to applications that don’t come through our own website (Because we use software to manage our hiring process, and without it, it would be the wild west here. So please be sure you’re applying on our website.)*Equal Opportunity Employer*Great ideas happen when diverse perspectives come together. Those perspectives are Taoti’s secret sauce. So building a diverse team and culture where everyone has a voice and is included in the process is not just the right thing to do. It’s good for business. We’d love your own perspective to add to our mix! We're eager for new, diverse voices to join the team and sincerely hope people from every walk of life will apply!*_Pretty please, no recruiters._*Job Type: Full-time	11192	Washington

Unit Context: SOUTH ASIA HEALTH (HSAHN):

South Asia has been the fastest-growing region in the world in recent years. This has led to impressive declines in poverty and to improvements in key HNP outcomes such as life expectancy and under-five mortality rates; with the right facilitative policies in place, most countries in the region are poised to reap a potential demographic dividend. Nevertheless, key challenges remain and new ones are emergent across the region: inequalities remain large and persistent, malnutrition remains a huge problem, financing for health remains largely out-of-pocket, and health systems are ill-equipped to face a growing burden from non-communicable diseases and from new risk factors related to urbanization and air pollution.

The Bank has an active and growing portfolio in the region, with lending operations, technical assistance, and analytical work focusing on improving health financing, service delivery, and governance both from within the sector and via support for multi-sectoral engagement. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted South Asia's major weaknesses in public health, including disease surveillance and diagnostics, as well as in health service delivery in terms of quality of care and surge capacity.

HNP has mobilized to assist all 8 countries in South Asia (including all HSAHN’s countries: Afghanistan, India, Sri Lanka, and Maldives) with its initial COVID-19 emergency response and essential systems strengthening. It is working now to help governments' shape their COVID-19 vaccine procurement and deployment strategies as an important next phase to the pandemic response.

The HSAHN team includes around 26 staff based in SAR countries and Washington DC. To strengthen the team, the WBG is recruiting a Senior Health Specialist based in Washington DC. The Senior Health Specialist will support the World Bank’s HNP portfolio, including the ongoing policy dialogue with Government counterparts and partners, preparation of analytical products, and the preparation and supervision of operations in the sector, as well as engagement on the broader human capital agenda,.
