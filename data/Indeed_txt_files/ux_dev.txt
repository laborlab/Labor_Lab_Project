As a UI engineer on the Open Instrumentation Experience team, you’ll be at the forefront of creating the modern observability experience. Our mission is to take APM to the next level by building intuitive user experiences that integrate with community-based standards like OpenTelemetry and W3C Trace Context. You will work together with New Relic's Open Source instrumentation engineers, exploring better ways to visualize and organize new sources of data. You will collaborate across organizational boundaries to create reusable components that other teams will depend on to deliver their own experiences. Not only will you help our customers improve how they troubleshoot their applications, but you will be a key part of shaping the future of how the observability industry thinks about and visualizes modern, open source telemetry.
This team is a phenomenal place to grow as an engineer. We have smart, supportive, and cultivating teammates, a wide product and technical landscape to explore, and an abundance of leadership and technical opportunities where you can shine. If you’re a mid-career or senior frontend engineer who is ready to work on a set of forward-looking projects in open source, this might be the role for you!
We are excited to consider a remote engineer for this role in the Pacific Standard Time zone. If you are not in the PST zone you must be willing to work within our core hours. Remote team members will work out of their home office and should have successfully worked remotely in the past.

In the first month, you will:
Become familiar with APM concepts and existing user experiences and workflows through our onboarding program, demos from your peers, and independent study
Work collectively on a small team using agile practices to ship your first PR to production

Directly attend customer interviews to better understand customer needs and use-cases
In the first three months, you will:
Implement rich, interactive data visualizations using modern JavaScript and software development techniques in partnership with the other engineers on the team
Ship incrementally and often, helping the team to maintain a constant flow of feedback on its work
Partner with product management, design, and other engineers to rebuild or reimagine how data from open sources is presented
Act as advisor for other internal UI engineering teams who haven’t been exposed to the new open standards data model - help them understand the differences and where it impacts their work
Help us deliver at a higher level through mentoring, pairing, code reviews, and providing support
Influence the direction of our roadmap, team processes, and become a significant contributor to planning and execution
In your first six months, you will:
Collaborate with instrumentation focused teams to build out curated experiences specific to programming language community needs
Work with a DevOps approach - while the pathfinding nature of the team means we’re not on call, yet, you should be prepared to evolve with us into a production supporting role which would include participating in an on-call rotation for the experiences we own
Your Qualifications
Must-have:
At least 4 years of professional front-end development experience
Strong React fundamentals with demonstrated experience writing performant and reusable components
Deep familiarity with modern Javascript (ES6+), HTML, CSS/SASS
