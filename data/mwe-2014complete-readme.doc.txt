The Modeled Wage Estimates (MWE) provide annual estimates of average hourly wages for occupations by selected job characteristics and within geographical location. The job characteristics include bargaining status (union and nonunion), part- and full-time work status, incentive- and time-based pay, and work levels by occupation. The modeled wage estimates are produced using a statistical procedure that combines survey data collected by the National Compensation Survey (NCS) and the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) programs.
