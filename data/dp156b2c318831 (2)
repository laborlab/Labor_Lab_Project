Dataset: Presents the average salary of civilian employees of the United States federal government based on geographic location. Statistics are reported by employing agency and occupation. Average salary represents the average adjusted basic pay, which is an annualized rate of pay. Adjusted basic pay is the sum of an employee’s rate of basic pay and any locality comparability payment and/or special pay adjustment for law enforcement officers. An employee's actual earnings may be more or less than the annualized rate because of factors such as overtime, shift differentials, less than full time work, or leave without pay. Invalid salary values are excluded from the average.
Presents data on civilian federal employees working in the United States, in total and by state, and in foreign nations. Included are statistics on counts of employees, salaries, and average length of service, by agency and occupation. Note that many agencies and offices in the federal government do not report human resources data to the Office of Personnel Management, including the White House, Judicial Branch, Congress, and more; for a list of included/excluded agencies, see the OPM’s Guide to Data Standards, available at https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/data-policy-guidance/#url=Data-Standards.

The Civil Service Act of the United States, signed in 1883, established the Civil Service Commission, which laid the foundations of an impartial, professional civil service based on the merit principle. In 1978, the Civil Service Commission was reorganized into three new organizations: the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Merit Systems Protection Board, and the Federal Labor Relations Authority.  Each of these new organizations took over a portion of the Civil Service Commission’s responsibilities, with OPM responsible for personnel management of the civil service of the federal government.
